Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Day 1: 
    
    Part 1: 

    Find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

    Part 2:

    Instead of considering the next digit, consider the digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches it.

Day 2:

    Part 1:

    Calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.
    

Day 3:

    Part 1:
    
    For each row in the spreadsheet, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value then calcualte the checksum.
    
    Part 2:
    
    Find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. Find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result and return the sum.
